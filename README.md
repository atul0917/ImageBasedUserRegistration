# ImageBasedUserRegistration
Web-based application developed using Java Server Pages (JSP), Servlets, and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). The main purpose of this application is to provide a platform for user registration where users can also upload their images.

1. User Registration: The application includes a registration module where new users can sign up. The registration form collects necessary details from the users.
2. Image Upload: During registration, users have the option to upload their image, enhancing the personalization of each userâ€™s profile.
3. JSP and Servlets: The application uses JSP for creating dynamic web content and Servlets for handling requests and responses between the web client and server.
4. JDBC: The application uses JDBC for connecting to the database, sending SQL queries to the database, and processing the results. User information collected during registration, including the image file, is stored in the database for persistent storage.
